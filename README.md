# Clustering_Cereal

1.	Using all the variables, except name and rating, run the k-means algorithm with k=5
to identify clusters within the data.

Cluster plot when number of clusters k=5
 
Develop clustering profiles that clearly describe the characteristics of the cereals within
the cluster.

K= 5, Within cluster sum of squares by cluster:
[1] 1.173452 6.335689 9.503646 1.287030 7.522469
 (between_SS / total_SS =  48.0 %)

Cluster 1 has shelf 3 and one shelf 2
Cluster 2 has shelf 1 and one shelf 2
Cluster 3 has shelf 3 and one shelf 2
Cluster 4 has a mix of shelf 1 and 2
Cluster 5 has a mix of shelf 1,2 and 3

Based on shelf and potassium

Shelf 2 which has potassium >220 belong to cluster 1

Shelf 2 which has potassium between 40-90 belongs to cluster 2,3
 
Shelf 2 which has potassium between 25-65 belongs to cluster 4 

Shelf 2 which has potassium more than 90 belongs to cluster 5

The clusters are formed based on the shelf. The next best differentiator after shelf is potassium level. 

Cluster formed using k-means, where k=5 will be better suited for analysis as the variance between the clusters are higher (48% for K=5) in comparison 3 clusters where the variance between the clusters is lesser (33.8% for K=3)
 
K=3, Within cluster sum of squares by cluster:

[1]  6.50960 16.83362  9.52699
 (between_SS / total_SS =  33.8 %)

Cluster 3 has only shelf 3
Cluster 2 â€“ 50% of Shelf 2 and 50% of Shelf 1
Cluster 1 has shelf 3 and one shelf 2


Cereal with average rating of 35.9 belongs to cluster 1
Cereal with average rating of 43.9 belongs to cluster 2
Cereal s with average rating of 48.7 belongs to cluster 3
Cereal with average rating of 27.6 belongs to cluster 4
Cereal with average rating of 62.7 belongs to cluster 5
